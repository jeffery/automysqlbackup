automysqlbackup (2.6+debian-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. With this new Debian release, I'm deciding to
  completely fork upstream work, as it's being impossible to work with
  upstream (no responsiveness), that upstream branch diverged, and is still
  containing the very bad security issue to save DBs dumps as world readable
  after my repeated warnings.
  * debian/copyright now using DEP5 format.
  * Added Vcs fields and a debian/gbp.conf.
  * Switching to source format 1.0 (quilt).
  * Removed now useless Dm-Upload-Allowed:, and now using my @debian.org email
  as maintainer.
  * Now depends on mysql-client-5.1 | mysql-client (and not 5.0 anymore).
  * Standards-Version: is now 3.9.2.
  * Remove "a" article in short description.
  * Added build-arch: and build-indep: targets in debian/rules.
  * Fixes Script fails with error when DBNAMES="all", thanks to Chris Moules
  <debian.bug@gms.lu> (Closes: #654388).

automysqlbackup (2.5-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixes the --opt issue with the information_schema that needs --skip-opt
    instead of --opt (Closes: #550037).
  * Added ${misc:Depends}.
  * Added patch to purge the rotated weekly backups that are older than 5
    weeks, if you selected SEPDIR (Separate backup for each DB), thanks to
    Gregor Hoffleit <flight@debian.org> (Closes: #572642).
  * Removes verbosivity when doing rm when LATEST is in use, as suggested
    by Frédéric Brière <fbriere@fbriere.net> (Closes: #574479).

automysqlbackup (2.5-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added Recommends: mutt (Closes: #532402).
  * Now uses a SHOW DATABASES statement to list all DBs to backup in the
    /etc/defaults/automysqlbackup, which is a lot more reliable than the
    previous folder listing (Closes: #539370).
  * Added some quotes in the script to avoid some parsing errors, which
    was reported by a user of the package (Closes: #534852).
  * Added more comments in the /etc/defaults/automysqlbackup.
  * Added a watch file.
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.8.2.

    performed). Thansk to jacques-billard@studio-jibe.com for reporting.
